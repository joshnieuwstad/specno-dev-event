# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

"Whenever there is loadshedding, I go to another zone where there is no loadshedding to get work done."

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

"Whenever I am stuck on aproblem, I try to get out of the room and do something else. Most of the time go on a run or to the gym."

## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?

"I write a list of task to do everyday and if I am not done with the tasks on that, I can't go out or do any other fun activity the next day"
