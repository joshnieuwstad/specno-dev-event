## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

## My Answer
Hopefuly my laptop battery is charged and i can use this time to review 
what i have done so far, or plan a bit better for what comes next. the 
other option would be to take a breather while the power is out  and later
work the time in. either way ill get my daily goals done (less sleep or skip 
shower time.). Coding is not about how long i code for. hours are irrelevant to me. i 
obssess about the problems and solutions so ill never just let something slide because 
of load shedding or any other type of interference.

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

## My Answer
I have faced many unexpected challenges inside and outside of 
work and the ony thing i know that helps to overcome them is opening 
up to team mates or family and friends and then building a solution 
together. no matter what it is, the most efficient solution is usually to 
share information and work together. 

## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?

## My Answer
I Set goals, long term and short term, i always(to my knowldedge) 
own up to my mistakes, ive learned that keeping quite about them is 
bad for a team. Im Also Extremely competitive so 
i think that might help alot.
