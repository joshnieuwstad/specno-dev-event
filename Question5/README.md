# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

- During the two hours of no internt, I could use it to think more about what I am building, plan out how I am going to approach the problem as soon the power is back on.

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

- I had to write an application that consumes api in javascript. 
I didn't know how to use this, so I looked through some tutorials on youtube and read documentation. I learn quite alot during this process, things I didn't know like callbacks, promises for async calls.
I used the acquired knowledge to build the application it wasn't perfect but I had addded skills in my catalogue which I know today.




## Accountability

Best way I keep myself accountable I set myself goals for each day/ week, lol more like sprints. Knowing I have tasks and sub-tasks to complete in a given period puts me on toes.
