# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

### Answer

If I know that the power will be off and for an unforeseen reason, I'm not at a power backup point; these are the steps I would follow.

- I would download the current projects I am working on to my laptop, which should last a while without power.
Based on this project, I would do tasks that do not require the internet.

- Once this is done, I will start tackling all my emails. The moment the internet goes back on, all the emails will send automatically.

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

### Answer

I was in an aeroplane, and as I was taking off with the plane I noticed I kept losing power. This was very strange and un declarable at first because all my checks showed that everything was in good working order.

What made it worse was that it was on an airshow and the runway was super busy.

I identified that non of the logical solutions is solving it, and I have to act quickly; otherwise, I might be in a lot of trouble.

I called the tower and informed them that I had a problem and needed to make a priority landing; they would have to clear any planes currently on the runway. I did not want to call a mayday because I could still manoeuvre to an extent to control the situation and use the altitude I had to my benefit to try to make a normal landing.

Keeping calm and open communication was essential in this situation, especially since so many people were present.

Luckily I could land safely even if I did land downwind instead of upwind.(This is not the norm)

After investigation, it was found that there were dirt particles in the fuel tank that caused the aeroplane to lose power every now and again as it blocked the fuel supply.

## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?

### Answer

I am a person who is hard on myself and always pushes to improve. I also have people in my life who I have identified who will call me on my BS if I am not focussing on the right things at any point in my life.

Part of these people is spiritual leaders session at least once a month, weekly mentor calls and much more.

I set goals for myself frequently as I tick off the previous goals and place an estimated deadline for achieving each goal.
