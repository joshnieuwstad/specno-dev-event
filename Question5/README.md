# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

Hopefuly my laptop battery is charged and i can use this time to review what i have done so far or plan a bit better for what comes next. the other option would be to take a breather while the power is out  and later work the time in. either way ill get my daily goals done (less sleep or skip shower time.)

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?
I overcome most things thinking that, things that go wrong are generally steering you to things that will go right. 

## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?
I Set goals, long term ans short term and i always(to my knowldedge own up to my mistakes), ive learned that keeping quite about them is bad for a team.
