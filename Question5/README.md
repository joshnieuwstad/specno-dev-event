# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

### Answer

If I know that the power is going to be off and for an unforseen reason I'm not at a power backup point, these are the steps I would follow.

- I would download the current project that I am working on to my laptop which should last a while.
Based on this project, I would do as much as possible of tasks that I do not require the internet.

- Once this is done, I would start tackling all my emails. The moment the internet goes back on, all the emails will automatically. 

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

### Answer

I have been in an airoplane, as I was taking off with the plane I notices I kept losing power. This was very strange un declarable at first because all my checks shows that everything is in good working order.

What made it worse was that it was on an airshow and the runway was super busy.

I identified that non of the logical solutions is solving it and I have to act quicly otherwise I might be in a lot of trouble.

I called for the tower and informed them that I have a problem and I need to make a prioroty landing, they would have to clear any planes that is currently on the runway. I did not want to call a mayday because I could still manouver to an extent to contol the situation and use the altitude that I have to my benefit to try make a normal landing.

Keeping calm was essential in this situation and open communication, as specially since there was so many people present.

Luckily I was able to land safely even if I did land down wind instead of up wind.(This is not the norm)

After investigation it was found that there was dirt particles in the fuel tank that caused the airoplane to power ever now and again.
## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?

### Answer

I am a person that is actually hard on myself and always push to be better. I also have people in my life that I have identified who will call me on my BS if I am at any point in my life not focussing on the right things.

Part of these people is spiritual leaders session atleast once a month, weekly mentor calls and much more.
