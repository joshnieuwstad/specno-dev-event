# Thinking Questions

The following questions are meant to be open ended and have no definite yes/no answer. Please feel free to explore your thoughts and write down whatever comes to mind.

## It's Load Shedding!

2pm on a Wednesday and the lights go out for the next two hours. Sprint ends on Friday and you have a lot of work to get through before then. However, without internet, you cannot interact with your co-workers or use the internet.

How do you make sure that when the power comes on again that you haven't just wasted two hours waiting around.

Load shedding has become such an integral part of our lives unfortunately and most of us are prepared in some way or another.
Well the way I see it, I have three options:
1. Stay where I am and do whatever work I can without internet, be it writing some code and hope its working as expected and wait for internet in order to fully test it. Or I could do some research by reading a software design book (if available). I will try not let the power outage get me down, there's always something to do!
2. I could go somewhere that does have power to finish my work, be it a coffe shop or home or work (if working from home).
3. Take the time to relax, clear my thoughts and take a walk. Being able to clear your head when stuck on a problem often leads to higher productivity. When the power comes back on, I can continue working and make up for the lost time.

Either way load shedding is not going to get in the way of the product, there's always a solution every problem!

## Running into a Wall

Please share a time when you faced an unexpected challenge (inside or outside of the work place). How did you overcome this challenge?

My biggest wall I hit was when doing my final year engineering project. It got to a point where I was feeling mentally burnt out and the fear of failure was overwhelming to a point where I was getting worried if I would be able to complete the project. It was all I could think about and constantly played in my mind when I went to sleep.

I decided to communicate my state of mind to my study leader and he was able to guide me to finishing the project. This reinstalled my self confidence in my ability to complete the project. I learnt that no matter the problems you are facing, commincating the problem outloud will greatly increase your ability of solving the problem.

## Accountability

How do you keep yourself accountable?

I like to question my own decisions. Ask myself why I made a certain action, sometimes one can believe they are making the right decision, but can change their mind after some reflection. 
I believe everyone should be heard and often after hearing someone else's perspective your own mind can be changed.
