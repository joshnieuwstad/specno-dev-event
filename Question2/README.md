# Star Border

Given a string array, `words`, return a string where the list of words are framed in a border made up of asterisks. The array will always contain at least one word.

### **Example 1**

```
Input: ['laptop', 'phone', 'charger']
Output:
***********
* laptop  *
* phone   *
* charger *
***********

```

### **Example 2**

```
Input: ['word']
Output:
********
* word *
********

```

### **Example 3**

```
Input: ['test', 't']
Output:
********
* test *
* t    *
********

```

## Thoughts and Processes

## First have to have the iterate the length of the words

## Next have to find the the word that has the maximum number

## From the top l have to add the asterik to the maximum number

## From the bottom l have to add the asterik to the maximum number

## I have to add extra spaces on the side by substracting it with the length of the word that has the max number of characters
