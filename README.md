# Specno Developer Event

### Welcome!

Before getting started with the technical questions, we'd like to welcome you one more time. Oh behalf of all the Specno developers and employees, we're super glad to have you here! We hope that that we can learn a little bit more about you and similarly, that you can learn a little bit more about us!

### The Challenges

This repo contains coding questions for you to complete during your time at here at the Specno offices. You'll notice 5 directories each with a different question for you to answer. 4 of those directories hold coding challenges while the last has a more conceptual question for you to tackle.

Currently, the question folders just have a readme that describes the problem. You are welcome to do these challenges in whatever language you please. You can simply make a file of your choosing and get started.

There are just a few things to go over before you start the challenges.

Obviously getting the coding questions correct is the goal. However, we understand that some developers might not perform their best under these circumstances so if you cannot get the challenges 100% correct, it isn't the end of the world. What we are really looking for is to evaluate your thought processes behind your solution. Therefore, if you can't get the code to work, it is imperative that you write down what you were trying to do. In fact, we ask that even if you get the code to work you still write your thought processes. A good place to start could be

- your first instincts when you read the question. From there you can explain how your thinking evolved into your solution.
- any hurdles or problems you had to overcome in the challenges.

Please add your thoughts to the **Thoughts and Process** section in the readme of the question.

### When you are done

You'll notice that this repo has a branch for each one of you. Before starting the challenges, make sure to checkout your branch and complete the questions there.

Once you are complete, you simply need to push your answers to remote so that we can review your code and thought processes later. This is a **crucial** step. If you do not push your changes to your branch we will not be able to review what you have done. This will be the end of the world xD

```
Make sure to checkout your branch and complete the questions there.

### Support from the Specno Devs

As mentioned in the welcoming talk, each one of you will be assigned a Specno developer to help you through these challenges. It is important for us to define what 'help you through these challenges' means. Is does not mean that we will simply give you the answer if you become stuck. Rather, we will act as a 'Rubber Duck' and help talk you through the problem you are facing. To reiterate, we are looking to evaluate how you think or how you approach problems. Getting stuck on a particular problem is a day to day thing in the life of a dev. How you become unstuck is what we want to see.
